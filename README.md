## Overview

This library is meant to simplify communication with the BOSCH085 Digital pressure sensor.
It is based on the great tutorial by adafruit (https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/253) and
the official documentation  (https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/BST-BMP085-DS000-05.pdf)

Connect the sensor using I2C to your Arduino. Rename this folder to BMP085 and place it in your Arduino libraries folder
