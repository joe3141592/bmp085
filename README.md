This library is meant to simplify communication with the BOSCH085 Digital pressure sensor:
This library is based on the great tutorial by adafruit: https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/253 and
the official documentation: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/BST-BMP085-DS000-05.pdf


Connect the sensor using I2C to your Arduino. Rename this folder to BMP085 and place it in your Arduino libraries folder
